 Dataset
- Original Dataset: [UCI Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)
- [Download dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00352/Online%20Retail.xlsx)
- Contains: ~500,000 transactions from a UK-based online store (December 2010 â€“ December 2011)
- Due to GitHub's 25 MB upload limit, this project uses a **10,000-row sample** saved as `online_retail_sample.csv`  
   The sample was created using the first 10,000 valid rows from the original Excel file.

  - Top Products by Quantity
  - Top 5 Countries by Revenue
  - Average Order Value
  - Revenue by Time of Day
  - Top 20% Customers by Revenue Share

  Advanced Analysis:
  - Returned Product Detection
  - Country-wise Product Popularity
  - Small Order Frequency by Customer
